# Project 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Description
This project explores search algorithms in the C programming language. The goal is to implement various search algorithms, understand their characteristics, and determine the best algorithm for specific use cases.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what a search algorithm is.
- Understand the concepts of linear search and binary search.
- Determine the best search algorithm based on specific needs.

## Resources
Before starting the project, it's recommended to read or watch the following:

- Search algorithm
- Space complexity (1)

## Project Timeline
- Project Start: Dec 11, 2023, 6:00 AM
- Project Deadline: Dec 14, 2023, 6:00 AM
- Checker Release: Dec 12, 2023, 12:00 AM
- Auto Review at Deadline

## Copyright - Plagiarism
Ensure that you generate solutions independently to meet the learning objectives. Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program. Do not publish any content related to this project.

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line.
- Mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder.

### Coding Style
- Code should follow the Betty style. Use `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` for style checking.
- No global variables are allowed.
- Limit each file to a maximum of 5 functions.
- Use only the printf function from the standard library. Avoid calls to other functions like strdup, malloc, etc.

### Example Files
- Main.c files are provided as examples for testing functions. You don't need to push them to your repo.

### Header Files
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in a header file named `search_algos.h`.
- Push your header file to the repository.
- Use include guards in all header files.

### Big O Notation
- Express big O notations using the specified format:
  - O(1)
  - O(n)
  - O(n!)
  - n*m -> O(nm)
  - n square -> O(n^2)
  - sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
  - log(n) -> O(log(n))
  - n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
  - ...

## Conclusion
By completing this project, you will gain a solid understanding of search algorithms in C and their respective complexities. Ensure that you adhere to the specified requirements and guidelines for a successful project submission.
